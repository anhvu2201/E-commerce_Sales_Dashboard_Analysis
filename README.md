# IV. Recomendation
## 1. Improve The Advantages:
- The Superstore should not change the main concept of its business, as they already done well and grow faster after each year (17% in 2011/2012, 25% in 2012/2013 and 26% in 2013/2014)
- The Superstore should stay focus and invest more on 3 main market: APAC, EU and US. They remained the top 3 market in revenue for Superstore from year to year.
- The Superstore should focus on high volume - high profit products, as they contributed the most for the growth of the business. They should also invest more to the low volume, high profit product, as Superstore already has a high base of customers - the business only need to bring these products to them to make a large sum of profit.
## 2. Solving The Problems:
- The Superstore should not worry much about the sales return - it stayed at an acceptable rate, only contributed for 6.4% of 4-year revenue. However, the business needs to identify the reasons for a notable increasing in sales return in 2014 after 3 stable year - it may be a indicator for something going wrong.
- The Superstore should improve its service quality in 3 country: US, China and Mexico. They were top 3 countries having the highest value of goods returned in almost every year from 2011 to 2014.
- The Superstore should improve its product quality in Technology segment, for particular Phones and Copiers. They will be the key products for Superstore, so they are needed to be invest on to keep the business flying high in the future.
